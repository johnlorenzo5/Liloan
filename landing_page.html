                    <h1>ABOUT LILOAN</h1>
                    <p>
                        Liloan is a charming municipality located approximately 18 kilometers north of 
                        Cebu City in the Philippines. Its name originates from the Cebuano word “lilo,” 
                        meaning “whirlpool,” inspired by the natural whirlpools found in its coastal waters. 
                        Historically, Liloan was part of Mandaue and later Compostela before being established 
                        as an independent parish in 1845, with San Fernando Rey as its patron saint. 
                        Though it briefly merged with Compostela during the American era in 1903, 
                        it regained its status as a separate municipality in 1919. Today, 
                        Liloan is known for its picturesque landscapes and historical landmarks, 
                        such as the Bagacay Point Lighthouse, built in 1904, which remains operational. 
                        It is also famous as the home of the beloved Rosquillos biscuits, 
                        a delicacy first crafted in 1907 by the local Titay’s bakery. The serene Silot Bay, 
                        with its lush mangroves and vibrant marine life, adds to the town’s appeal. 
                        Liloan’s cultural identity shines through its annual fiesta in honor of 
                        San Fernando Rey every May, featuring vibrant parades, religious ceremonies, 
                        and community celebrations. While embracing modernization, 
                        the town preserves its rich heritage and local traditions, 
                        making it a unique blend of history and progress.
